# Student Mental Health Analysis

**Objective:** Explore relationships between sleep, stress, and mental health among students.

**Dataset:** [students.csv]  
**Tools Used:** Python, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy  

## Key Questions
1. How do sleep hours affect mental health?  
2. Does academic stress correlate with mental well-being?  
3. Are there gender differences in mental health outcomes?

## Process
1. Data cleaning & preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Statistical testing (t-test)  
4. Visualization & insights

## Insights
- Students sleeping < 6 hours had higher stress levels.  
- Academic stress is the strongest predictor of poor mental health.  
- No significant difference by gender.
